# Movies_Recommendation_System
  
### In this project I implemented Collaborative Filtering to create a recommendation system for movies. The data was acquired from "MovieLens" and it contains 27,000,000 ratings and 1,100,000 tag applications applied to 58,000 movies by 280,000 users.  

#### Types of Recommender Systems  
Generally, there are two major ways to build recommender systems: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.  
  
##### Content-Based Filtering
Here, the similarity between different products is calculated on the basis of the attributes of the products.  
For example, in a content-based movie recommender system, the similarities between movies is calculated based on genres, actors, etc.  

##### Collaborative Filtering
Here, we leverages the power of the crowd.  
Meaning, if a user A likes products X and Y, and if another user B likes product X, there is a fair bit of chance that user B will like product Y as well (at least that's the general idea).
